Customer economics (or unit economics) is something that we've been validating for a while at stratejos.ai. At an early stage, it can be difficult to get an accurate number for CAC and LTV - this doesn't mean you shouldn't try!

I was fortunate enough to sit in on Austin Neudecker giving a talk at SD Convergence 2019 on customer economics. Austin's background in VC and founding startups provided good insights from both sides of the fence. There where a couple of key takeaways that should be relevant to any early stage product teams.


#### Are you building a business or a product?
- Building a business means that you want to get to a point where the money that you make from each customer is greater than what it cost you to aquire them
- If you don't know how much a customer is worth, how you get your customers and how much they cost to get then you will probably end up with a product but not a business 

#### It is never too early for customer economics
- Always start with a model. The model will be wrong but it provides a starting point to get your assumptions about your customers and market down on paper.
- As you begin to test channels, acquire customers and measure your pirate metrics (aarrr) you can validate/invalidate the model and refine your assumptions

#### Understands your numbers per channel
- Customers acquired via different channels will not only have different acquisition costs but will likely have different LTV
- Channels have different capacities. Understand not only the size of the market that you are going after but also how large each channel you are using can grow.
- You may find that early on with SEM (Search Engine Marketing) that you can get great customer economics for certain keywords. Be careful when forecasting forward as highly targeted searches may have limited volumes that don't scale out well.

#### Growing without advertising isn't a superpower
- Claiming that you have grown without spending a dollar on marketing is not a good thing. It shows two problems. Firstly that you haven't done the math to value any time spent on personal outreach, content or whatever has been driving customers. Secondly, it shows that you haven't been testing paid acquisition channels and paid channels are often easier to scale after raising funds.

#### You are probably trying too many channels

- Even early on you should be doubling down on the most promising channels
- Spend only 10-15% of your budget experimenting with new channels

#### Always know these numbers

1. CAC  - How much does it cost you to acquire one additional customer. know this per channel.
2. LTV - How much do you expect to make per customer.
3. Channel  - What channels are you using and what is the difference in metrics between these channels
4. Mkt Size - How large is the initial market you are going after. What assumptions did you use to calculate this
5. MoM growth - What is your monthly growth rate. Know this for your different customer segments.
