As part of my new process for annual goal setting (see previous post) I'm putting my themes and goals out publicly. 



## Themes for 2019 

1. Create more things of value and consume less content 
2. Be intentional with where I spend effort, identify opportunities to leverage maximum effort
3. Put myself out there publicly and be willing to fail
4. Be more balanced in earning vs investing 



## QI Goals

- Mediate for 900 minutes 
- Write and promote 6 personal blog posts
- Update my personal site
- Build an MVP of the Daily KPI product 
- Complete 24 gym sessions 
- Attend 4 meetups and find an opportunity to support the community 
- Track a weekly budget for 4 weeks 
- Invest $10K with entry and exit points defined
