##Why I fail at yearly goals
Setting aggressive and specific annual goals has never been that effective for me. This year I set out to design a better process for setting and achiveing goals...

Mark Zuckerberg has become famous for his oversized contribution to the genre. You set a large and specific goal for the year, one that will take large time and focus commitment and result in a simple pass/fail. Twitter, blogs, podcasts and social media all light up with people excitedly planning out things they will have achieved 12 months from now. It's interesting to not how less frequently you see how they goals ended up.  

I suspect that for a lot of people, if they are anything like me, the cycle probably goes something like this. Get exctied and use the New Year to reflect and dream big. Be inspired by others doing the same thing. Write down exciting and audacious goals. Picture how great it will feel when you have achived them. Work hard on making them happen for a few weeks and then...... 

Life has gotten in the way. Your priorities have changed, that thing that seemed super interesting in December is less so in March. You've changed job, been promoted, got interested in a new challenge and now those specific goals you set months ago seem both irrelevant and out of reach. Since they now seem out of reach it doesn't make much sense to focus on them anymore so you forget all about them. Never mind there is always next year. 

##Designing a better system 

##Challenges##

 The starting point I took was to consider the motivations and types of goals that I had behind why and how I had  set goals in previous years. Getting past the superficial stuff we tell ourselves I arrived at: 

 1. Achieving some sign of external success be that a promotion, degree or money 
 2. Wanting to be one of those people who sets and achieves annual goals

External success measure may be initially inspiring but for me they fade quickly. The bright shiny thing that at first seemed so me chasing gets replaced by another amd since you don't value the journey there is little to keep you pushing during the grind. 

Wanting to **be** on of those people who **has** done something seems to be quite common. You picture how happy you will be once you've summitted Everest but you rarely think how it will be during the climb. 

The shortfalls of my current drivers for doing yearly goals were: 

- Both do a poor job of valuing sustained effort over a long period
- They don't provide internal motivation 
- They focus on external measures 
 
The next thing I looked at was the process, or lackthereoff in my case, I had used to make my yearly goals happen. 

Ther first obvious point is that I had no real system, at least not one that was written down anywhwere. The second was there was no accountability for either achieving or working towards the goals. 
 
## Goals for the new system ##

Refelcting on the challenges I've had in previous years I came up with a list of things that the new system should focus on: 

- Intention 
- Reinforcement 
- Flexibility 


## System

What I came up with 

1. Set themes for the year
2. Share them with people 
3. Create measurable quarterly goals (no more than 1 or 2 per theme)
4. Share publicly 
5. Have a goals buddy to review them with each quarter
