# 2019 Themes 

Annual goals have never been that effective for me. You write them down, picture how great it will be when you achieve them, working towards them for a few weeks and then..... nothing. 

This post is about changing this cycle for 2019. 

In re-designing how I set (and achieve) goals for the year I had a number of things I wanted to improve: 

- Intention 
- Reinforcement 
- Flexibility 



## Themes

1. Create more things and consume less content 
2. Be intentional in where I spend effort, identify opportunities to apply maximum effort 
3. Put myself out there publicly 
4. Be more balanced in earning vs spending 



## QI Goals

- Mediate for 900 minutes 
- Write and promote 6 personal blog posts
- Update my personal site
- Build an MVP of the Daily KPI product 
- Complete 24 gym sessions 
- Attend 4 meetups and find an opportunity to support the community 
- Track a weekly budget for 4 weeks 
- Invest $10K with entry and exit points defined
